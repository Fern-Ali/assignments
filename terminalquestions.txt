terminal is just an interface to the shell. The shell is what actually handles commands 
the terminal program is how we interact with the environment.

An absolute path - starts from the root and gives the full location for a file or folder
 A relative path - starts at the current location and not the root route
 A flag adds more options to a command, like  -a and -l for the ls command and -r for the cp and rm commands
 r will remove folders and go through each folder and file 
 f will force removal
